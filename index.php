// Solve 

/**
 * Here a and b are the two input variables.
 * By adding values to the variables a and b it is stored in a variable named x which is then printed by echo.
 * The following 3 examples have been printed separately.
 * The line break has been given through the br tag.
 */

// Example 01



$a = 10;
$b = 9;

$x = $a + $b;

echo "x = $x";
echo "<br>";

// ==================================================


// Example 02

$a = -10;
$b = 4;

$x = $a + $b;

echo "x = $x";

echo "<br>";

// ==================================================


// Example 03

$a = 15;
$b = -7;

$x = $a + $b;

echo "x = $x";


// Many thanks for verifying my solution.
